<h2>How to get a pet rock</h2>
<p> Hi again. </p>
<p> This section is about how to get a pet rock. </p>
<p> First, you need to find a rock. </p>
<p> After you find a rock, you need to give it a face, a name, and other stuff that a pet might have (e.g. a collar). </p>

<p> Lastly, you will have to arrange a meeting with a supreme court judge to get your rock legally adopted. Illegal ownership of pet rocks can have severe consequences, such as being arrested or having your rock taken away from you. </p>
